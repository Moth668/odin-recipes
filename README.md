Odin Recipes

https://moth668.github.io/odin-recipes/

This is the first project of my journey through The Odin Project. An HTML program to practice the foundations HTML lessons, including but not limited to: boilerplate HTML, headings, anchors, hrefs, and images. 

I'm also practicing using Git to organize the project repository with high quality Git commits.
