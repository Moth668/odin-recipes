    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Above and beyond the great taste and texture, these "sloppy chickens" were
      incredibly simple to make. All we do is dump everything in the saucepan,
      simmer until tender, and then eat.
    </p>
    <p>Original recipe yields 4 servings</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <li>
        Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic,
        yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken
        thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.
      </li>

      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <li>
        Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in
        the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30
        seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for
        the mixture to boil.
      </li>

        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls
        apart, about 1 1/2 hours.
